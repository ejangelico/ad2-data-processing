#NOTE - software channels in ad2_reduction and struck_reduction must be unique identifiers of the channel.
#cannot have a copy of channel 1, for example, listed in both ad2 software channels and struck channel_numbers. 
#they will be overwritten in the reduced_df dataframe. 


#reduction / processing parameters related to files generated by the analog discovery 2 digitizer
ad2_reduction:
  #each ad2 digitizer, if multiple, is represented by a prefix here. In Run 5 and 6, we only use one AD2. 
  #note some important differences: the sample rate and timing of the event changes on an event by event basis
  #if the settings change during data logging (which sometimes happens). They are parsed in the header of the file. 
  "glitch": #file prefix before timestamp
    software_channels: [2, 3] #this is a software defined number, can be anything but sets flags in the analysis. 
    active_channels: [0, 1] #two channels on an AD2, [0, 1]. Put which ones you want parsed. 
    filter_tau: 0 #ns, filtering anode signal gaussian, 0 for no filtering
    polarity: -1 #expecting negative pulses 
    no_pulse_threshold: 0 #if max-sample is less than this, don't integrate
    fit_amplitude_threshold: 0.002 #if max-sample is above this, fit the exponential to get tau and amplitude
    integration_window: [400, 1000] #us, skip integrating the baseline samples, just integrate this window about peak time.
    baseline_window: [0, 400] #us, region over which to calculate mean of baseline 



struck_reduction:
  prefix: "pmts" #this prefix will be attached to dataframe columns associated with this digitizer for later reduction stage. 
  #this replaces the channel map file functionality of the NGMBinaryFile reading. 
  active_channels: #references the struck data 
    0: [0,1,3] #channel numbers that are active in this slot (0) 
  software_channels:
    0: [0,1,4]
  events_per_file: 500 #number of events to chunkify the data into for saving to pickle files during binary processing. 
  clock: 125e6 #Hz clock rate. 
  polarity: 1 #expecting positive or negative pulses
  mv_per_adc: 0.03 
  no_pulse_threshold: 15 #mV, amplitude to discard the event as having nothing
  baseline_window: [0, 40] #number of samples over which to calc baseline
  pulseheight_window: [40, 60] #the region where the primary pulse lands due to trigger timing
  afterpulse_window: [65, 1000] #the region after the primary pulse where afterpulsing may occur. 
  
  #the struck C++ code that writes a datetime to the filename
  #has a constant offset that is wierd. Use this to correct that timestamp
  timestamp_offset: -25200 #seconds to add to the filename timestamps on struck files.  

  impedance: 25 #ohms, it was set to 50 ohms on struck and we have 50 ohms in the discriminators.

month: "10" #for a stupid reason, I can't put the month or year into the AD2 datafile names and its needed for good date parsing.
